Keyboard DDR is a Guitar-Hero inspired keyboard game with a Christmas theme. Two classes
were implemented, "Note" and "Button." The "Note" class is responsible for creating each
pressable note for all of the songs. The "Button" class which also has an extension called
"NewGame" is responsible for the clickable buttons that take you to each of the three songs.
Each song has varying difficulty that is determined through the "Note" class. The minim
sound library was used to implement sound. There are two GUI systems. The first one is the
main menu and the second one is the game over menu that is activated once the song ends.
The game over screen can also be activated in the middle of the song by clicking the
appropriate button on the screen. The most difficult aspect of the game was the Santa
cursor which implements two hierarchies of animation, the movement of Santa himself and
the movement of the reindeer relative to Santa. Data input was fulfilled through the
implementation of textures for the notes and image backgrounds.

Het did the Note class, the implementation of the keyboard functionalities, and the
sound functionalities. Lauren did the Button class, the main menu GUI, and the Santa 
cursor. Jiiajun did the score functionality as well as the game over GUI.

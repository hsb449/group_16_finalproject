Our project is a keyboard version of dance dance revolution. It is also holiday themed.

We chose 3 songs which are our 3 levels of difficulty. Increased difficulty means increased speed and frequency of steps to hit.

Game Play:

1. Open the group_16_finalproject.pde file. Click the 'Run' button.

2. Click on the ornament with the difficulty level you would like to play, using the Santa cursor, led by jumping reindeer.

3. Press 'D,' 'F,' 'J,' or 'K' when the step crosses the circle targets at the bottom of the screen. The bottom targets with the letters on them will enlarge when you hit the button and a beeping-type sound will play when you hit a note correctly.

4. You earn points based on the number of notes you hit correctly and can earn a high-score placement.

5. The game will end when the song finishes. You will see a Game Over screen, where you can choose to 'play again,' which will return you to the main menu.

Note:

If you would like to mute the audio at any point, press the 'M' key to mute and 'N' to unmute.
